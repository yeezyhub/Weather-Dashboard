## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our daily lives, with the help of technological advancements we are able to access the information more every other day. One of them is the weather and forecast data. Using the Open Weather API, I was able to learn how to collect data from a database and come up with this project that shows the current and projected weather data(ex. temperature, wind speed, humidity) for the next five days of any city in the world. This project is going to help people to be prepared for the unexpected weather conditions.
## Usage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default location is set to Austin, TX. The user may type in to see other cities' current or projected five days weather conditions data. The search history is located underneath the search bar for easy access to the previously searched locations.
